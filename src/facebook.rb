  class GraphAPI
    # A client for the Facebook Graph API.
    # 
    # See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api for complete documentation
    # for the API.
    # 
    # The Graph API is made up of the objects in Facebook (e.g., people, pages,
    # events, photos) and the connections between them (e.g., friends,
    # photo tags, and event RSVPs). This client provides access to those
    # primitive types in a generic way. For example, given an OAuth access
    # token, this will fetch the profile of the active user and the list
    # of the user's friends:
    # 
    #    graph = Facebook::GraphAPI.new(access_token)
    #    user = graph.get_object("me")
    #    friends = graph.get_connections(user["id"], "friends")
    # 
    # You can see a list of all of the objects and connections supported
    # by the API at http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/.
    # 
    # You can obtain an access token via OAuth or by using the Facebook
    # JavaScript SDK. See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/
    # for details.
    # 
    # If you are using the JavaScript SDK, you can use the
    # Facebook::get_user_from_cookie() method below to get the OAuth access token
    # for the active user from the cookie saved by the SDK.
    
    # initialize with an access token 
    # and a service that provides a make_request(path, args, verb) interface
    def initialize(access_token = nil, service_module = NetHTTPService)
      @access_token = access_token
      if service_module.method_defined? :make_request 
        self.class.send(:include, service_module)

    def get_object(id, args = {})
      # Fetchs the given object from the graph.

      # Fetchs all of the given object from the graph.

      # Writes the given object to the graph, connected to the given parent.
      #

      #     graph.put_object("me", "feed", :message => "Hello, world")
      # 
      # writes "Hello, world" to the active user's wall. Likewise, this
      # will comment on a the first post of the active user's feed:
      # 
      #     feed = graph.get_connections("me", "feed")
      #     post = feed["data"][0]
      #     graph.put_object(post["id"], "comments", :message => "First!")
      # 
      # See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api#publishing for all of
      # the supported writeable objects.
      # 
      # Most write operations require extended permissions. For example,
      # publishing wall posts requires the "publish_stream" permission. See
      # http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ for details about
      # extended permissions.
